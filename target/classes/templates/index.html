		<h1>About Us</h1>
		<h3>The Ku Klux Klan commonly shortened to the KKK or the Klan,
			is an American white supremacist, right-wing terrorist, and hate
			group whose primary targets are African Americans, Jews, Latinos,
			Asian Americans, Catholics, and Native Americans as well as
			immigrants, leftists, homosexuals, Muslims, abortion providers and
			atheists. The Klan has existed in three distinct eras. Each has
			advocated extremist reactionary positions such as white nationalism,
			anti-immigration and especially in later iterations - Nordicism,
			antisemitism, anti-Catholicism, Prohibition, right-wing populism,
			anti-communism, homophobia, Islamophobia, anti-progressivism and
			anti-atheism. The first Klan used terrorism both physical assault and
			murder against politically active Black people and their allies in
			the Southern United States in the late 1860s. The third Klan used
			murders and bombings from the late 1940s to the early 1960s to
			achieve its aims. All three movements have called for the
			"purification" of American society, and are all considered far-right
			extremist organizations.In each era, membership was secret and
			estimates of the total were highly exaggerated by both friends and
			enemies.</h3>
